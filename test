FS#182 - CAN Scan
How to use the OP-COM cable to view CAN data?

!!! Attention !!!
When accessing the car's CAN directly, you need to be careful! A lot of data is sent via CAN, the meaning of which no one outside GM knows. Sending random data to CAN can put some module/controller in an undefined state, from which it can be difficult to recover later! Usually disconnecting the power supply (battery) helps.
I am not responsible for any damage caused by direct access to CAN.

Hardware/Software Requirements
all tools were checked/tested only on Linux/Debian and should work there. Linux requirements:

SocketCAN (every newer distribution has built-in support)
Python 3.4+
Python packages: pyserial, python-can
OP-COM interface/cable, tested only with software 1.59. We do not need OP-COM itself.
We can also use a ready Linux virtual machine and run it with VirtualBox.
We download the machine fromhttps://mega.nz/file/YXxVjYLB#MX5TJBJFsxWFL7ovvLTF-LcP08oQ0U4IhAPNni07XEY

We import the machine to VirtualBox and run it

login: osboxes
password: lwpm
root password: lwpm
Preparing the system
All required files are available in the /home/osboxes/opel directory, while all tools are text-based, so we do everything from the terminal.

However, if you want to prepare the system yourself, I assume you know how to configure it:

we install python3.4+
install can-utils (apt-get install can-utils)
we install pip (apt-get install python3-pip)
we install pyserial and python-can (pip3 install pyserial && pip3 install python-can)
On systems other than Debian/Ubuntu the commands may be different.

The first step to do is to run vcan_init which will create virtual interfaces (LSCAN, MSCAN, HSCAN) in Linux. They will be used to access the physical CANs in the car.

so we log in to the system, run the terminal, go to the opel directory (cd opel) and enter:

sudo ./vcan_init
confirm with the root password (lwpm)
At this point we have created virtual CAN interfaces that we can use now.

The next step is to connect the OP-COM interface to the virtual machine and connect it to one of the CANs. The opcom.py program is used for this purpose , which we run as follows:

./opcom.py /dev/ttyUSB0 lscan
to connect the OP-COM interface with our virtual CAN (LSCAN),
to connect to mscan we enter the following:

./opcom.py /dev/ttyUSB0 mscan
we do it similarly for HSCAN

./opcom.py /dev/ttyUSB0 hscan
In the case of HSCAN, OP-COM will hang very quickly due to too much data that it cannot process, so we call the program with appropriate filtering of incoming packets, eg:

./opcom.py /dev/ttyUSB0 hscan filter:-1,-1,7DF,7E0,5E8,7E8
this way we will only capture communication with the engine control unit (ECU)
The first two filter parameters are a bit mask. I don't really know how to use it, so we use -1,-1 to filter everything, while the next values are the specific PID identifiers we need. We can specify up to 6 identifiers!

CAN Sniffer
Now that we have connected the car to our computer, we can see what's going on inside :)
the most important commands are cansniffer and candump

candump lscan
cansniffer lscan
the first one prints all incoming packets to the screen, while the second one does exactly the same, except that it groups them by identifier, showing only what has changed. It is worth reading the help for these commands to get a better presentation of the data (use the –help parameter).
The most important calls are:

candump -a -c lscan
candump -l lscan
The first one prints the packages in color and shows the texts they contain,
the second one saves all downloaded packages to a file, eg for further analysis.

Sending packages
To send packets to CAN we basically have two most important programs: cansend and canplayer. Using canplayer we can send previously saved packets to CAN,
while using candump we can send a specific packet to CAN, eg:

cansend mscan 223#00772823
this command will send a packet with id 223 and length 4 bytes to MSCAN.

you just quoted the instructions on how to do it...

which step is incomprehensible?

 
Ostapcommented on 25/09/2018 19:48
All of them, Luke, all of them.

I would like it to be step by step what needs to be installed on a bare system, how to do it, what to enter in the command line, what to do next, etc. etc.

How to install opcom, how to check and connect it with these programs, etc., etc.

Just step by step.

I know that for you it is obvious (like for me fishing, making bait, lures, rigs, bait boats, etc. etc.) but I would like instructions for an idiot, simply.

 
Ostapcommented on 26/09/2018 16:06
Hello

Any info? :)

 
froniu1commented on 30/09/2018 08:57
For a Zafira or Astra hi, everything is worked out. The frames themselves won't give you anything in my opinion because everything has to be in the software. The only thing to work out is VC and you don't have this car.

 
Ostapcommented on 30/09/2018 10:42
Seat heating too? Heating diodes? DDS button? Locking?

I know that frames won't do me any good, but putting them in the software is the least of my problems.

take a look at the description and try it out

let me know if something is not clear, I will correct or add to it

 
Ostapcommented on 25/10/2018 12:29
Oh man ;) there will be something to do ;)

So fast

Is this Linux machine x32 or x64?
Will it boot from a pendrive or only from a virtual?

I'm asking because my laptop doesn't support virtualbox.

 
Admin
LWPMcommented on 25/10/2018 12:50
in what sense doesn't it support VirtualBox? it's just a regular program :)
unless you actually have some antique...

the machine is 32 bit

 
Admin
LWPMcommented on 25/10/2018 12:51
if necessary, install what you need according to the list above and use the included programs

LWPMcommented on 25/10/2018 12:59
if someone knows how to make an image for a pendrive from this... no problem - I don't really know how to go about it

 
Ostapcommented on 25/10/2018 13:17
My laptop is ancient ;)

If the image isISOor similar then the pendrive can be made with Rufus or similar.

VirtualBox unfortunately no longer works on x32 ;)

 
froniu1commented on 25/10/2018 19:38
An old lamptop, I mean? Old equipment is sometimes a limitation. My laptop with i3 is from 2014 and it handles virtual. Maybe it's better to buy something more or less used and give the antique to a museum ;)?

 
Ostapcommented on 25/10/2018 20:22
I mixed it up ;) Virtualbox works, but there is something like this when starting the image

Another virtuali program doesn't work, I forgot the name.

On Linux Mint it's the same because I have it installed on my disk

Mint: regarding you didn't install python packages: by default:

pip3 install pycan
pip3 install pyserial
what about Debian... I don't know... maybe the processor doesn't support PAE?

 
Ostapcommented on 26/10/2018 07:36
I'll check it after work ;)

 
Ostapcommented on 26/10/2018 21:18
And that's it from my testing :)

As if to spite me, it doesn't want to work on Debian or Mint. Just an error.

Do you have any ideas?

Well, rather. Or at least under opcom. Without opcom it will throw errors.

 
Ostapcommented on 28/10/2018 05:12
I have the interface connected but I do everything at home.
I don't think it will matter if the car is connected.
I'll check in the car today.

The car does not need to be connected for it to work.

A little bit of advice

apt install python3-setuptools
pip3 install can
I think you are installing packages for python3 and you are using python2.7

Run like this:

python3 opcom.py
 
Admin
LWPMcommented on 28/10/2018 07:53
Show what it shows

pip3 letter
 
froniu1commented on 28/10/2018 09:13
Well without the car it should get to the point where the sniffer sends some data to CAN and waits for a response. You are getting some errors, maybe the interface is not detecting it?

 
Ostapcommented on 28/10/2018 09:52
I think my interface is not 1.59 but something like 1.43 or similar.

How do I check if the system sees the interface and what name it is?

 
Ostapcommented on 28/10/2018 09:54
lsusb
I guess that's it ;)

 
Admin
LWPMcommented on 28/10/2018 11:25
It should be under /dev/ttyUSBx or /dev/ttyACMx.

Connect OPCOM
Show what lsusb shows
Disconnect OPCOM
Run van_init
Connect OPCOM
See if it is visible in /dev/tty

Ew show show what you see in dmesg when connecting OPCOM
